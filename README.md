# Parafoil test On-Board Software [![pipeline status](https://git.skywarder.eu/scs/pyxis/obsw/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://git.skywarder.eu/scs/pyxis/obsw/commits/master)

*On Board software for Parafoil tests*

To clone, use `git clone --recurse-submodules git@git.skywarder.eu:scs/pyxis/obsw.git`.

To build, use `sbs` (for more info, type `./sbs --help` on Linux or `sbs --help` on Windows).
