/**
 * @file ActuatorsMacros.h
 * @brief Macros for the Actuators module
 *
 * This file contains macros to simplify the creation of ValveInfo structs
 * for the Actuators module.
 *
 * The hardware mapping (hwmapping.h), the actuators configuration
 * (ActuatorsConfig.h) and the registry keys (Registry.h) have been created with
 * a specific naming convention to allow the use of these macros, to reduce the
 * amount of code repetition and to make the code more readable during servo
 * creation.
 *
 * The following naming convention is used:
 * - The servo name is an uppercase string code (e.g. OX_FIL)
 * - Constants are expected to be in the Config::Servos namespace
 * - The servo name is used to create the following constants:
 *      - MIOSIX_SERVOS_{servo}_TIM             (hwmapping)
 *      - MIOSIX_SERVOS_{servo}_CHANNEL         (hwmapping)
 *      - {servo}_LIMIT                         (ActuatorsConfig)
 *      - {servo}_FLIPPED                       (ActuatorsConfig)
 *      - Common::MOTOR_{servo}_OPEN            (Events)
 *      - Common::MOTOR_{servo}_CLOSE           (Events)
 *      - hwmapping::{servo}_LED                (hwmapping)
 *  - The following constants are used for all servos:
 *     - MIN_PULSE
 *     - MAX_PULSE
 *     - FREQUENCY
